# Movie Recommender System

This is a movie recommendation system that recommends movies based on a user's selection of a movie from a list. After a user selects a movie, the program recommends five other movies that are similar to the selected movie, along with their posters.

The movie recommendation system uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to analyze movie plots and metadata, such as genre and director, to find movies that are similar to the selected movie.
